# Rabbit
*“Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!”*

![preliminary keyboard layout for Rabbit](img/rabbit-prelim.png)

Rabbit is yet another ergonomic keyboard strongly influenced by both [TGR Alice](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=95009.0) and [Bemeier BMEK](https://github.com/bemeier/bmek):
* Ergonomic layout
* [HHKB](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/) influence
* More symmetric than Alice, less symmetric than BMEK
* Focus on curved rows rather than rotated clusters
* Personal idiosyncrasies (like moving ‘6’ to the right side and using HHKB sizing for bottom modifiers)
